  as long as if pandoc support it.


*** How to build

You need ruby 2.x installed. I only test the build on ruby 2.4. Don't forget to
install [[https://bundler.io/][bundler]] to manage ruby gem packages.

Besides, you also need [[https://pandoc.org/][pandoc]] installed. I only test pandoc [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.19.2.1][1.19.2.x]] version.

Steps to ~compile~ the site:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git@github.com:xiaohanyu/xiaohanyu
bundle install
bundle exec nanoc compile
#+END_SRC

It may take several minutes to build the whole site. You can check the compiled
site in ~output~ directory.

My website is hosted on [[https://pages.github.com/][github pages]]. You can push the contents under ~output~
directory to github pages. If you have customized DNS, don't forget to modify
[[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/xiaohanyu/blob/master/content/CNAME][CNAME]] for your website.


*** Website metadata

Most of the website metadata is stored in [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/xiaohanyu/blob/master/nanoc.yaml][nanoc.yaml]] file, like the author,
title, keywords, etc.


*** Development

Besides compile, you can write post and build website simultaneously:

- use ~bundle exec guard~ to watch for file changes and run ~nanoc compile~.
- you can use [[https://browsersync.io/][browsersync]] as ~cd output; browser-sync start --server
  --files="**/*"~ to watch the compiled changes in browser simultaneously.
